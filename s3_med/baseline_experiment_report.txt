Baseline Experimental Framework and Results Analysis for ICU Mortality Prediction

Experimental Setup and Methodology

This study establishes a comprehensive baseline framework for ICU mortality prediction using the MIMIC-IV dataset, evaluating four distinct methodological approaches ranging from traditional machine learning to advanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques. The experimental setup processes 500 test patients from a carefully curated patient cohort, utilizing temporal physiological measurements including 17 vital signs (capillary refill rate, blood pressure readings, FiO2, Glasgow Coma Scale components, glucose levels, heart rate, SpO2, pH, respiratory rate, temperature, and anthropometric measurements) collected during ICU stays. The data preprocessing pipeline transforms raw clinical time series into structured text representations while preserving temporal dynamics and clinical context.

Baseline Approaches and Implementation

Four baseline methodologies were systematically evaluated: (1) Traditional machine learning classification approaches leveraging engineered features from temporal clinical data; (2) Direct large language model (LLM) prediction using Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct with structured prompting, where patient clinical narratives are directly processed for mortality risk assessment; (3) Naive RAG-enhanced prediction, incorporating retrieval of relevant medical knowledge from a curated medical corpus to augment the LLM's decision-making process with domain-specific information; and (4) Similar cases RAG approach, which combines patient similarity matching using dynamic time warping (DTW) with weighted physiological indicators, retrieves analogous historical cases (k=3), and integrates both similar patient outcomes and relevant medical documentation to inform predictions.

Data Split and Processing Strategy

The test dataset comprises 500 patients randomly sampled from the MIMIC-IV ICU cohort, maintaining the natural class imbalance reflective of real-world ICU mortality rates (approximately 9% positive class). Each patient record includes comprehensive temporal sequences of vital signs, diagnoses codes, and clinical measurements. The text generation pipeline converts numerical time series into natural language descriptions, preserving clinical significance while enabling LLM processing. To address computational constraints, intelligent prompt truncation strategies were implemented, maintaining essential clinical information within the 8,000 character limit while preserving narrative structure through selective content preservation.

Results and Performance Analysis

The experimental results reveal distinctive performance characteristics across methodologies. The Direct LLM approach (Baseline 2) achieved 27.4% accuracy with high recall (97.8%) but poor precision (10.8%), indicating aggressive positive classification tendencies. The Naive RAG implementation (Baseline 3) demonstrated improved balance with 82.2% accuracy, achieving precision of 13.9% and recall of 17.8%, suggesting that medical knowledge integration helps reduce false positives. The Similar Cases + RAG approach (Baseline 4) achieved the highest overall accuracy at 82.8%, with precision of 16.4% and recall of 22.2%, demonstrating that historical case similarity provides valuable prognostic signals. The AUROC scores ranged from 0.500 for direct LLM to 0.679 for the similar cases approach, while AUPRC values remained consistently low (0.09-0.139), reflecting the challenge of extreme class imbalance. The confusion matrices reveal that while traditional approaches struggle with sensitivity, the integration of retrieval mechanisms and similar patient matching progressively improves the identification of high-risk patients while maintaining acceptable specificity, establishing a robust baseline for future mortality prediction research in this critical care domain.
