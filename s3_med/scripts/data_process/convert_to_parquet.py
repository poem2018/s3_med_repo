You should show your thinking process between <think> and </think>. You should show the search query between <query> and </query> in JSON format.
Based on the search query, we will return the top searched medical literature between <information> and </information>. You need to first think (<think>) on the retrieved information and put the doc id (1, 2, 3) of the important documents between <important_info> and </important_info> (e.g., <important_info>[1, 2]</important_info>).
After reviewing the information, you must decide whether to continue searching with a new query or indicate that the search is complete. If you need more information, formulate a new search query OR use <search_complete>False</search_complete> to indicate you want to continue searching. If you have sufficient information, use <search_complete>True</search_complete> to indicate that you have gathered enough information.

Focus on finding literature about:
1. ICU mortality prediction models and risk factors
2. Clinical parameters associated with ICU mortality
3. Specific conditions or abnormalities present in the patient
4. Prognostic indicators for critically ill patients
